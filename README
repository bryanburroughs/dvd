# DVD Home Application

Most of this code is several years old and was originally written for Rails v1.
It now works with Rails v3.

It also includes Scaffolds - my lazy way of adding new DVDs to the database.
This may eventually be removed.

NOTE: I renamed scaffold.css since it was interfering with my custom css.
